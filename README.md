All my life I have enjoyed the pleasure of being a growing front-end developer.
and I've always wanted to go for full-stack development but I've always been compelled by fear of it being difficult
and also because of high school.. being in the seminary for the high school is not an easy one but it has brought me to this point


This is my first ever Express code 

I look forward to using it in building a workable complete functioning web app
